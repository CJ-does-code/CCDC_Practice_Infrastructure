# HAProxy
What is this service, the level of difficulty of this inject.

**Time**: XX (Contains the estimated time of competition)

## Expectations 
What should be implemented and completed by the time this inject is completed 
1. We should have a list of all users on all machines 
2. All unauthorized users should be logged, and locked
3. The password requirements on all Linux machines must bet set to a modern general standard (12 chars, uppercase and lowercase, etc)
4. ...

## Dependencies
What could be attacked while this inject is being implemented to throw those completing it off balance. If a person is auditing users, what happens if more users are added!

## Inject
This is where creative writing skills come into play I guess. Imagine how they could ask you to do this. Then make it more obscure.
