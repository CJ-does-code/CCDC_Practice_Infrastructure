# Security Operations Center
This Directory will contain documentation for Security Operations Center for both Windows and Linux systems. As this a **HUGE** focus with the NECCDC region this has been separated out into it's own directory.

Each service we look into for secret management will have its own directory placed into the Linux or Windows folder depending on which operating system it was designed to run on.
