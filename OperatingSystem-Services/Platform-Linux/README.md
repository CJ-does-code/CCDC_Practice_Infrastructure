# Linux Platform Documentation.
This folder will contain documentations relating to any services that will be ran solely on a *Linux* system, mainly focusing on proxies and linux configurations or access programs. The organization may vary, but generally services will each be in their own directory, and if there are multiple services capable of doing the same thing such as *Nginx* and *HAProxy* they will be contained in a directory named after their category of service, in this case *Proxies*.

We will push any Bash scripts into the [0-Scripts](./0-Scripts/) directory and any Ansible playbooks into the [1-Ansible](./1-Ansible/) directory.
