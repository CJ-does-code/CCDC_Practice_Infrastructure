# Writeups 
This directory contains writeups for TEAM-2 Please use the following structure for the files.

## File Structure
Please create a **markdown** file that is called your name, example ```matthew_harper.md```. This will be placed in the folder corresponding to the meeting or event. 

If you are unfamiliar with markdown it is not so bad you can find a few sites to learn it.
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

If you need multiple files feel free to make a subdirectory that is your name instead of a file with your name.

**DO NOT UPLOAD SENSITIVE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION** The other team may decide to look at this. If it can be known put it here otherwise we need to figure out how that will be kept.

## Contents of Writeup 
Get Chris to post his slideshow. But mainly what did you do, and how did you do it. If you feel verbose (as you are required to be) put in what you learned if anything, and how the team can be improved. Also we need to include opinions on how the experience was both good and bad.
