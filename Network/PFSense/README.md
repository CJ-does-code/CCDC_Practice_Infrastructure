# PFSense 
This file describes the setup and configuration of the PFSense Instance

## Initial Machine Setup
### Downloading ISO
1. Ssh into proxmox
	ssh [root@192.168.0.60](mailto:root@192.168.0.60)
	Type in password
2. Navigate to the directory where ISO files are stored in linux
	1. cd /var/lib/vz/template/iso
3. Go to PF Sense download page on your regular browser & fill out download specifications
	1. <img src="Images/Image1.png" width=400>
	2. You may have to click Download once, so the actual download link with the correct details are linked to the download button
		1. This may be needed b/c I am unsure how often the webpage updates
	3. **Right click the Download Button** & save the link
4. Navigate back to the ssh console and pull the iso file from the web
	1. use wget "web page link"
	2. Full cmd - wget https://atxfiles.netgate.com/mirror/downloads/pfSense-CE-2.6.0-RELEASE-amd64.iso.gz](https://atxfiles.netgate.com/mirror/downloads/pfSense-CE-2.6.0-RELEASE-amd64.iso.gz)
	3. <img src="Images/Image2.png" width=400>
5. Unzip the file inside the same Linux ISO directory
	1. Using cmd - Â gunzip pfSense-CE-2.6.0-RELEASE-amd64.iso.gz

4. **OS Tab**
	1. Click **use iso file**
	2. Press **Storage: Local**

	<img src="Images/IsoLocal.png" width=400>
5. **System Tab**
	1. Leave as default
   	<img src="Images/Step3.png" width=400>
6. **Disks**
	1. 8gb minimum 
	2. I set the Disk size to 12gb 
	<img src="Images/Step4.png" width=400>
7. **CPU**
	1. Leave as Default or as you prefer
	<img src="Images/Step5.png" width=400>
8. **Memory Tab**
	1. 1gb is required
	2. I gave 3gb
	<img src="Images/Step6.png" width=400>
9.  **Network Tab**
	1. ***The bridge changes dependent on the network the PFsense firewall is supposed to communicate with
	2. vmbr2 is our linux bridge
		1. If we were connected to a windows bridge it would not be vmbr2 but vmbr1, b/c we named them like that
	3. **Multiqueue** = 8
		1. Allows the BSD kernel to negotiate the optimal value with Proxmox VE in the Network configuration
	<img src="Images/Step7+.png" width=400>
	4. I am unsure if the Firewall box is supposed to be checked or not
		1. I left it in it default state

The next tab is a confirmation tab, aka overview of out settings. Just hit next & don't forget to start the machine.

You have successfully added the PFSense ISO to is appropriate machine.

But you have not configured the fire wall software yet.
