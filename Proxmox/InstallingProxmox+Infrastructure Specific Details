## Steps

1. Install latest (or of your choice) version of Proxmox in the form of an .iso file 
    https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads

2. Download an application called Etcher (see Reference 1.) which can create a bootable usb using the iso file
    Etcher allows you to configure/write images&iso files to portable storage media ie. USB, CDs

3. Plug th usb into the computer to with Etcher & the Iso downloaded on iy(not proxmox computer) and use Etcher to create bootable USB. (See Reference 2.)

4. Navigate to the computer you want to install proxmox on and boot it with the usb.
    - This will likely mean navigating to the bios menu on the target computer.
    - Make it first in the boot sequence in the bios menu
    - Hit exit & the target computer should boot from the inserted media

5. As the computer is starting. When prompted with what disk you want to select make sure NOT to max out the disk as it will not allow to install (For our infrastructure we limited proxmox to 100 gb to the chosen disk)
 - reserve space for installation media and any other programs that will be need on the target machine

6. Set up the computer credentials

### Note: - Error Msg. 
    Once you hit install and you have an error in which one of the packages doesnt install you will have to reinstall the iso as it didnt get mounted on the bootable usb correctly or didn't install correctly from the website.
