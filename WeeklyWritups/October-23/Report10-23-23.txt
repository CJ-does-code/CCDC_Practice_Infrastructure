RedTeaming

Experience: Overall was okay. Not much was accomplished, as thing were rushed, but I now know what to expect.

Issues: A bit chaotic and fast paced, but it was okay. Confusing about what needed to be done after 20 minutes of recon was up. Was very hard finding vullurabilities after that time. 

To-Do: Look into some base knowledge networking, figure out and fully understand network diagrams. Look for vulnurabilities from these diagrams.
