RedTeaming

Experience: Overall was okay. Not much was accomplished, as thing were rushed, but I now know what to expect.

Issues: A bit chaotic and fast paced. Confusing about what needed to be done after 20 minutes of recon was up. Was very hard finding vullurabilities after that time. Needed good base knowledge to figure out what was really going on, as I was just trying to ssh into one machine over and over again. 

To-Do: Look into some base knowledge networking, figure out and fully understand network diagrams. Look for vulnurabilities from these diagrams.
