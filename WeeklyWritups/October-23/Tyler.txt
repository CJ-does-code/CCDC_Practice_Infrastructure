Tyler Rafferty
Week 2 writeup

Over the week
I reaserched some windows related attacks
including adding a user and disabling windows defender
Finished seeting up AD on the windows machine

During the meeting:
I didn't know how to to rpd connect so during the original 
10 minutes I wasn't able to connect to the other teams machine
which led to us not having access or really doing much offensivly

This led me to do some research on how to better defend for next week
which includes getting another virus detector like norton
Checking over to see if any accounts are added
Making sure defender and notifications are turned on
Seeting up a firewall
