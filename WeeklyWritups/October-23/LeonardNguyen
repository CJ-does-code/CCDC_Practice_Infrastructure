Team 1 Red Team:

Homework:
To prepare for our meeting, I wrote a powershell script as part of our Red Team repository to be used for our attacks. In my script specifically, I wrote a powershell script that takes advantage of Window's built-in Guest account system by creating an guest account, then giving it admin permissions. 

Monday Night:
I went into the meeting thinking I'd be running the script I made for homework under the assumption that we'd all have full access to the blue team's infrastructure. It makes a lot more sense in hindsight knowing now that we'd actually have to work for the access. Fortunately, I did learn of the existence of the brute force ssh tool Hydra, although I didn't use it in Monday's meeting. Overall, the first 10 minutes was spent just trying to figure out how to access... everything?

The 20 minute strategizing period was somewhat more stable as we started figuring out our roles and the first steps to our attacks. We were split into groups of 3 and my group was tasked with creating a ton of noise to slow down whatever work the SIEM/Rocky machines needed to do to defend against the scripts our team prepared.

From here on, I tried playing by ear, figuring out what the rest of the team was working on. I did manage to hear that the Rocky 2 server's password got removed, so I sshed into that and watched people run their sh scripts on there.

Overall, I was a deer in headlights. At least now I have a pretty small idea of what to expect for our next meeting when blue teaming.
