## Homework ###
During the week leading up to the meeting I was tasked with writing a scirpt to disable the windows defender, disable windows defeneder notifications and when windows defender is turned back on exempt the entire C drive. 

## Mondays Meeting ##

In the first ten minutes of the meeting during the free access period I did not get much done becuase I was not sure what exactly I was meant to do. I knew the goal was supposed to get into their machines and run the scripts that we prepared with the homework, but I did not know how to rdp into their windows machines to do that. I probably should have learned before hand how ot do these things.

After the 20 minutes of strategizing was over I went back into the google spreadsheet that we got sent and tested the defualt passwords and usernames to check if they had not changed any one them. Turns out they did not change the default username and password for Rocky Linux 1 and 2. However, after me, Riley, and Amaan got into those machines I got confused as to what the next step was. I tried to get access to some of the more importent machines, like their router and teleport but I could not figure out how. 

One thing I did figure out how to do was after Amaan ran a nmap scan I used the IPs for PFsense and the ports we got from the nmap scan to find their portainer page and their PFsense login page. However I could not figure out how to login to the PFsense page becuase of low time. Also they disabled the portainer so I just basically ran into more dead ends unfortanetly. 

In all my first experience red teaming was a rocky road for me, partly becuase I think i did not put in enough effort outside of the meetings to learn what I needed to do during the meeting to be successful.
