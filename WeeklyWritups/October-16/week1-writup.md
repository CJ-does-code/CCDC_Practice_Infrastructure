## Experience

__Cool. Good planning time in the beginning this time so we knew what was going on. Everyone got their assignments.__

---

## What I learned

__Mostly went through the teleport setup again. Started to learn about the difference of using self-signed certs compared to using CA.__

## What I did

- Pulled ubuntu 22.04 server onto proxmox
- Deployed ubuntu vm (hostname; t1-teleport)
- Installed teleport and got configuration done. 
- Service is running, at 2FA setup point.
- Deviations were made and documented from github repo for steps 3,4,5.

## Whats next

- On blue team side, continue deploying
- On red team side, uhhh idk ;).

---

## Challenges

- Need to learn how teleport + CA works, gonna test it at home since I have lets encrypt setup already for homeserver stuff.
