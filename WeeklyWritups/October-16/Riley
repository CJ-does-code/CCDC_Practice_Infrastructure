Riley Conners 10/16 Writeup
I was on the proxy team with Leo
We share machine 402 (Team1Proxy/DNS) with the linux DNS team

What we did: 
- Downloaded the ubuntu 22.04 image to the VM
- Got SSH running with the default cybersecurity password
- Installed squid proxy for ubuntu
- Saved the original config file for when bad mistakes are made
- Changed the SSH password to something random to be more secure against the red team
- All passwords, budget usage, OS’s, and IPs are in a shared google sheet.

There is also a shared google sheets file but I’m not sure if I should be putting it here since the other team can also see the github.
