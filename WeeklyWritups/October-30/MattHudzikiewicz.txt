I am on the SOC team, and the week leading up to the meeting we tried to setup some of the agents which we got done successfully and then our firewall went up and our agents
disconnected so we had to figure out how to get those agents back online. However, once the competition between the two teams actually started our agents disconnected again.
I think another thing I could of done leading up to the meeting was do more work on our dashboard and queries so we could see what intrusion was happening to us. Even though
our agents were down we should of had more things in place assuming our agents would have been alive. Throughout the meeting I did not think i did not do enough monitoring 
either becuase we still had two agents alive so i think I could have done a little bit more in that department. What we really tried to get done during the meeting was making
sure our passwords were secure for wazuh, which we did succeed in although we were not able to change the password of the wazuh dashboard becuase you are not able to do it
from the gui interface, so we spent a little time researching how to do that but we could not figure it out. Once again I think I could have put in more work offline to 
make this experience more enjoyable for me.
