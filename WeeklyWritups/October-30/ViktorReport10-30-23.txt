Blue Team Week

Overall Experience: Overall things could have gone better, as me and my team ran into a lot of problems that took a lot of time to figure out. Not too much wazuh'ing was really done. 


Pre Meet:
 - Worked on finding/creating queries for Wazuh, as well as adding a little bit to the dashboard
 - Creating and connecting the agents


Issues/Complications: 
 - Timing for when red team was done attacking/blue team could start defending was a bit confusing, as a time was first given but then changed. 
 - First task for Wazuh was to reset all of our passwords, I went out to change the SIEM machine password, and mixed up the regular account password with the root password, which led to some confusion and trouble. This was thankfully sorted out after a couple of minutes. 
 - Changing the Wazuh dashboard password proved to be unsucsessful, as nothing me and my team tried seemed to work. 
 - After that, once we tried to Wazuh through the dashboard, only a couple of agents were still connected. 


To-Do: 
 - Figure out how to look through agents and their vulnerabilities - maybe set up some dashboards for this. 
 - Figure out how to maintain contact with the agents, making sure that they don't get disconnected, and if they do, find a way to reconnect them as quickly and safely as possible.
 - Add in some rules for FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) on the agents, as this would help out a lot.

And lastly, figure out the best and most efficient way to change passwords on both the SIEM machine and Wazuh dahsboard.
