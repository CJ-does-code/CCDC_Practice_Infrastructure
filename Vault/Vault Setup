# Installing Vault on Windows

ITC = In this Case.

# Install Choco
```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))```

    Allows you install different packages on windows    

A reboot may be required.
## Confirm Choco is installed
    Type Choco in the command prompt and choco's version # should appear.

#  Install Vault
```choco install vault```

- Type 'yes' to all installation
  
## Verify Vault installation
```vault```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create the vault Config file
Creating a config file instead of using the -dev flag allows us to create the vault more securely.
Name the configuration file "config.hcl"
There is a configuation file folder (current config is insecure b/c TLS is disabled)

# Make the directory the storage (itc. raft)
```mkdir -p ./vault/data```


# Start the vault server w/ specific config file
(We are **Not** setting up a dev server, which are insecure by default.)
This is the only piece that interacts w/ data storage and backend.
```vault server -config=config.hcl```


You should see a message at the top
  - "vault server configuration" & 
at the bottom
 - "==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Initialize the vault (only happens once)
Only happens once when the server is started against a new backend 
In a new terminal, set the  VAULT_ADDR enviornment variable 
```export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'```

The next command to run in the terminal is 
 ```vault operator init```
"see Keybase Initialization" or
"GnuPG" (preferable) for more secure versions
This command generates 
1. **unseal keys** 
2. **initial root token**
  - we want these to be as secure as possible, thats why we use GnuPG or keybase.io.


------------------------------------------
# Unseal the vault
Unseal =  "process of teaching Vault how to decrypt the data is known as unsealing the Vault"
Unsealing has to happen every time the vault starts
To unseal the vault you need to have the **Key threshold** amount of unseal keys (see )

```vault operator unseal``` 'paste in valid key after the command'
 - You will need to do this the same amount of times as the **key threshold** .
 - Pasting a different key each time


## First Output
 - should be something similar to this
Unseal Key (will be hidden):
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true
**Sealed             true**
Total Shares       5
Threshold          3
Unseal Progress    1/3
Unseal Nonce       d3d06528-aafd-c63d-a93c-e63ddb34b2a9
Version            1.7.0
Storage Type       raft
HA Enabled         true


## Final Output Key                     Value
---                     -----
Seal Type               shamir
Initialized             true
**Sealed                  false**
Total Shares            5
Threshold               3
Version                 1.7.0
Storage Type            raft
Cluster Name            vault-cluster-0ba62cae
Cluster ID              7d49e5fd-a1a4-c1d1-55e2-7962e43006a1
HA Enabled              true
HA Cluster              n/a
HA Mode                 standby
Active Node Address     &lt;none&gt;
Raft Committed Index    24
Raft Applied Index      24

- When sealed changes to false, your good to move on.



# Login in to vault
```vault login```







# Write secrets to a vault
Vault Hashicorp has a bunch of secret engines, which are somewhat a kin to databases with special features and each have their own type of data they store.




## Key/Value Secrets Vault
### About:
This vault stores data in key/value pairs.


### Syntax:
vault kv <subcommand> [options] [args] 
vault kv put -mount=secret creds passcode=my-long-passcode




vault kv put -mount=secret hello foo=world
```vault kv put secret/hello foo=world```
"foo=world" : key=value pair secret
"secret" : The path
    

- You can use real files as secrets, which are more secure. You can replace foo=world with a textfile.

- kv
  - Key/Value secrets engine
  - (ITC) kv is the base path for the vault for the dev server. 


# Retrieve Secrets
vault kv get secret/foo

vault kv get -mount=secret foo




# Details about Vault

Secrets are encrypted and then written to the backend storage
Backend storage never sees the value



# Terminating vault server
## Kill the running vault server
```Ctrl+C``
Terminates the server that is running at http://127.0.0.1:8200

## Unset the Vault Token
```unset VAULT_TOKEN```
