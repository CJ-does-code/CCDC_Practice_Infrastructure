### ALL IPA COMMAND LINE COMMANDS
(https://freeipa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/commands.html)
```
This will most likely be the most frequented website you use.

For Commands, go to "IPA API Reference" and then "IPA API Commands"

Note the difference between API and CLI commands, in the CLI all underscores in the command name should be replaced with a dash.

More top level ideas are in "FreeIPA design documentation", but this will most likely only be of use for language to use in inject writing.

"FreeIPA Workshop" has some tutorials with commands, but only go here if something is missing or not working in the FreeIPA notes here.
